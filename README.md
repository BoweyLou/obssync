## Why obs-sync?

**The Problem**: You love Obsidian for note-taking and task management, but you also want your tasks accessible across all your Apple devices through Reminders. Manually keeping them in sync is tedious and error-prone.

**The Solution**: obs-sync provides **intelligent, bidirectional synchronisation** that:
- ✅ Automatically syncs tasks between Obsidian markdown files and Apple Reminders
- ✅ Preserves task metadata (due dates, completion status, priority, tags)
- ✅ Handles conflicts intelligently (most recent change wins)
- ✅ Supports multiple Obsidian vaults with separate Reminders lists
- ✅ Enables tag-based routing (e.g., `#work` tasks → Work calendar)
- ✅ Detects and removes duplicates automatically
- ✅ Safe dry-run mode to preview all changes before applying

**Perfect for**:
- 📝 Knowledge workers who live in Obsidian but need mobile task access
- 🎯 GTD practitioners managing tasks across contexts
- 👥 Teams using Obsidian for project management with Apple device integration
- 🔄 Anyone who wants seamless cross-platform task management

---

## Key Features

### 🔄 Bidirectional Sync
- Changes in Obsidian → Reflected in Apple Reminders
- Changes in Apple Reminders → Reflected in Obsidian

Sync calendar events to Obsidian daily notes:
```bash
obs-sync calendar
```
Creates timestamped entries in your daily note for today's meetings and events.

### 🔍 Task Metadata Preservation
Syncs all task properties:
- ✅ Completion status (`[ ]` / `[x]`)
- 📅 Due dates
- ⚡ Priority levels (high/medium/low)
- 🏷️ Tags
- 📝 Notes/descriptions
- 🕒 Created/modified timestamps

### 🛡️ Safe & Reliable
- **Dry-run by default**: Preview changes before applying
- **UUID-based tracking**: Stable task identity across syncs
- **Conflict detection**: Warns about simultaneous edits
- **Orphan cleanup**: Removes stale sync links automatically

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Initial Setup

Run the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
obs-sync setup
```

This will:
1. **Discover Obsidian vaults** on your system
2. **List available Reminders lists** from your Apple Reminders
3. **Map vaults to Reminders lists** (which vault syncs where)
4. **Configure tag-based routing** (optional but powerful!)

Example setup flow:
```
📚 Discovered vaults:
  1. Work Notes (/Users/you/Documents/Work)
  2. Personal (/Users/you/Documents/Personal)

📋 Available Reminders lists:
  1. Work
  2. Personal
  3. Shopping

Map Work Notes → Work
Map Personal → Personal

Configure tag routing for Work Notes?
  #urgent → Work (already mapped)
  #client → Work
  #admin → Work
```

### 2. First Sync (Dry Run)

Preview what would change:

```bash
obs-sync sync
```

Example output:
```
🔍 Syncing vault: Work Notes
📊 Summary:
  Obsidian: 45 tasks found
  Reminders: 38 tasks found
  Matched pairs: 35

📋 Planned changes:
  ✅ Obsidian → Reminders: 8 creates, 2 updates
  ✅ Reminders → Obsidian: 3 creates, 1 update
  🗑️  Deletions: 0

🔗 Tag routing:
  #client tasks → Work (5 tasks)
  #admin tasks → Work (2 tasks)

💡 Run with --apply to execute these changes
```

### 3. Apply Changes

Once you're happy with the preview:

```bash
obs-sync sync --apply
```

Tasks are now synchronised! ✨

### 4. Ongoing Sync

Just run the sync command whenever you want to synchronise:

```bash
obs-sync sync --apply
```

**Pro tip**: Add this to a cron job or use macOS Shortcuts for automatic syncing.

# Initial setup (interactive wizard)
obs-sync setup

# Add more vaults or Reminders lists
obs-sync setup --add

# Reconfigure existing settings
obs-sync setup --reconfigure
```

#### Sync Operations

```bash
# Preview changes (safe, read-only)
obs-sync sync

# Apply changes (bidirectional sync)
obs-sync sync --apply

# Sync specific vault
obs-sync sync --vault "Work Notes" --apply

```

### Task Format in Obsidian

obs-sync recognises standard Obsidian task syntax:

```markdown
## My Tasks

- [ ] Basic task
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Task with due date 📅 2024-10-15
- [ ] High priority task ⏫
- [ ] Task with tags #work #urgent
- [ ] Task with note
  Additional details go here in the indented block.
```

**Supported metadata:**
- `[ ]` / `[x]` - Completion status
- `📅 YYYY-MM-DD` - Due date
- `⏫` / `🔼` / `🔽` - Priority (high/medium/low)
- `#tag` - Tags (also used for routing)

---

## Advanced Features

### Tag-Based Task Routing

Route tasks to specific Reminders lists based on tags:

**Setup routing:**
```bash
obs-sync setup --reconfigure
# Choose "Amend existing configuration"
# Select "Configure tag routes"
```

**Example configuration:**
- Tasks with `#work` → Work Reminders list
- Tasks with `#personal` → Personal Reminders list
- Tasks with `#urgent` → Priority Reminders list

**In practice:**
```markdown
- [ ] Prepare presentation #work         → Work list
- [ ] Buy birthday gift #personal        → Personal list
- [ ] Review contract ASAP #work #urgent → Work list (first match wins)
```

### Multi-Vault Workflows

Manage different projects in separate vaults:

```bash
# Setup multiple vaults
obs-sync setup --add

# Sync specific vault
obs-sync sync --vault "Project A" --apply

# Sync all vaults
obs-sync sync --apply
```

Each vault maintains independent configuration and sync state.

### Deduplication

Remove duplicate tasks across Obsidian and Reminders:

```bash
# Preview duplicates
obs-sync sync

# Interactive deduplication (prompts for each cluster)
obs-sync sync --apply
# When duplicates detected, you'll be prompted to choose which to keep
```

**Duplicate detection criteria:**
- Same description (fuzzy matching with 75% similarity threshold)
- Same or similar due dates (within 1 day tolerance)
- Detects both Obsidian-Obsidian and Reminders-Reminders duplicates

### Custom Configuration

Configuration stored in `~/.config/obs-sync/config.json` (or custom location):

```json
{
  "vaults": [...],
  "reminders_lists": [...],
  "vault_mappings": {...},
  "tag_routes": {...},
  "min_score": 0.75,
  "days_tolerance": 1,
  "include_completed": true
}
```

**Key settings:**
- `min_score` - Similarity threshold for matching (0.0-1.0)
- `days_tolerance` - Date matching tolerance in days
- `include_completed` - Whether to sync completed tasks

### Advanced Matching

With the `optimisation` extra installed, obs-sync uses the Hungarian algorithm for optimal task matching:

```bash
./install.sh --extras macos,optimisation
```

Benefits:
- Better matching for similar tasks
- Reduced false duplicates
- Optimal global assignment vs greedy matching

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `OBS_TOOLS_HOME` - Custom location for managed virtual environment
  ```bash
  export OBS_TOOLS_HOME=~/my-custom-location
  ```

- `OBS_SYNC_HOME` - Custom location for config/data files
  ```bash
  export OBS_SYNC_HOME=~/.my-sync-config
  ```

### Managed Virtual Environment

Location:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/obs-tools/venv`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/obs-tools/venv`
- **Windows**: `~/AppData/Local/obs-tools/venv`

### Configuration Files

- `config.json` - Main configuration (vaults, mappings, settings)
- `sync_links.json` - UUID mappings between Obsidian and Reminders tasks
- `obsidian_tasks_index.json` - Cached Obsidian task index
- `reminders_tasks_index.json` - Cached Reminders task index

### Logs

Logs are stored in:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/obs-tools/logs/`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/obs-tools/logs/`

---

## Troubleshooting

### "command not found: obs-sync"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Reload your shell
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bash_profile

# Verify ~/.local/bin is in PATH
echo $PATH | grep ".local/bin"

# Manually add if needed
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### "EventKit not available"

**Solution:**
```bash
./install.sh --extras macos
```

**If still failing:**
- Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Reminders**
- Enable access for **Terminal** or **iTerm2**
- Restart your terminal

### "Permission denied" when running install.sh

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make installer executable
chmod +x install.sh

# Or run with bash
bash install.sh --extras macos
```

### Sync shows unexpected deletions

**Likely causes:**
1. Tasks were manually deleted in Obsidian or Reminders
2. Tag routing changed (task moved to different list)
3. Vault path changed

**Solution:**
- Review dry-run output carefully: `obs-sync sync`
- Check orphaned task detection is working correctly
- Reconfigure if vault paths changed: `obs-sync setup --reconfigure`

### Tasks not syncing

**Debugging steps:**
```bash
# 1. Run with verbose output
obs-sync sync --verbose

# 2. Check logs
tail -f ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-tools/logs/obs-sync.log

# 3. Verify task format
# Ensure tasks use proper markdown syntax: - [ ] Task description

# 4. Check configuration
cat ~/.config/obs-sync/config.json
```

### Installation fails

**Solution 1 - Clean reinstall:**
```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-tools/venv
./install.sh --extras macos
```

**Solution 2 - Custom location:**
```bash
export OBS_TOOLS_HOME=~/custom-sync-location
./install.sh --extras macos
```

## Architecture

### How It Works

1. **Task Discovery**
   - Scans Obsidian vault for markdown task syntax
   - Queries Apple Reminders via EventKit framework
   - Builds indexes with stable UUID identifiers

2. **Matching**
   - Links tasks using UUID-based sync links
   - Falls back to fuzzy matching for new tasks (description + due date similarity)
   - Uses Hungarian algorithm for optimal matching (with `optimisation` extra)

3. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Compares modification timestamps
   - Most recent change wins
   - Preserves all metadata during updates

4. **Sync Application**
   - Creates missing counterparts in Obsidian/Reminders
   - Updates changed tasks bidirectionally
   - Removes orphaned tasks (deleted on one side)
   - Persists sync links for future runs

### Key Components

- **obs_sync/sync/engine.py** - Core sync orchestration
- **obs_sync/sync/matcher.py** - Task matching algorithms
- **obs_sync/sync/resolver.py** - Conflict resolution
- **obs_sync/sync/deduplicator.py** - Duplicate detection
- **obs_sync/obsidian/tasks.py** - Obsidian task parser
- **obs_sync/reminders/gateway.py** - Apple Reminders integration
