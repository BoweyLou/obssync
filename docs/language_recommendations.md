# obs-sync Language Update Status

All user-facing language recommendations from the prior review have been implemented across the CLI. The following modules now use the refreshed copy:

- `obs_sync/commands/setup.py`
- `obs_sync/commands/sync.py`
- `obs_sync/utils/prompts.py`
- `obs_sync/commands/update.py`
- `obs_sync/commands/install_deps.py`
- `obs_sync/commands/migrate.py`
- `obs_sync/commands/calendar.py`
- `scripts/cleanup/clean_reminders.py`
- `obs_sync/main.py`

Each prompt and instruction now matches the consolidated guidance for tone, clarity, and formatting. No further language changes are pending in this document.
