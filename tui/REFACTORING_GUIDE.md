# TUI Controller Refactoring Guide

## Overview

The TUI controller has been decomposed from a monolithic 1580-line class into a cleaner architecture using specialized service objects. This refactoring improves maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns.

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Monolithic Controller)
- **Single File**: `controller.py` (1580 lines)
- **Mixed Responsibilities**: UI state, configuration, caching, validation, logging, command execution all in one class
- **Hard to Test**: Tightly coupled components made unit testing difficult
- **Difficult to Extend**: Adding new features required modifying the large controller

### After (Service-Oriented Architecture)
```
controller_refactored.py (400 lines) - Main controller, delegates to services
├── config_service.py        - Configuration management
├── environment_validator.py - Environment and dependency validation
├── data_cache_service.py    - Data caching and diff computation
├── log_service.py           - Logging and log management
└── command_handler.py       - Command orchestration
```

## Service Responsibilities

### ConfigurationService
- Load/save application preferences
- Manage configuration paths
- Handle vault configurations
- Provide Python environment paths

### EnvironmentValidator
- Validate EventKit availability
- Check sync environment setup
- Validate required files exist
- Platform-specific checks

### DataCacheService
- Cache task indices and links
- Compute diffs between versions
- Track changes over time
- Optimize file I/O with mtime-based caching

### LogService
- Manage application logs
- Tail component logs
- Find run summaries
- Handle log rotation

### CommandHandler
- Execute sync operations
- Manage command arguments
- Handle operation callbacks
- Coordinate multi-step operations

## Migration Steps

### 1. Update imports in main application

```python
# Old
from tui.controller import TUIController

# New
from tui.controller_refactored import TUIController
```

### 2. No API changes needed

The refactored controller maintains the same public API:
- `__init__(view, service_manager)`
- `handle_input() -> bool`
- `get_current_state() -> Dict[str, Any]`
- `log_line(s: str)`

### 3. Testing improvements

Services can now be tested independently:

```python
# Test configuration service
config_service = ConfigurationService()
prefs, paths = config_service.load_config()
assert paths["obsidian_index"] is not None

# Test environment validator
validator = EnvironmentValidator(config_service)
valid, issues = validator.validate_sync_environment()
assert isinstance(valid, bool)

# Test data cache
cache = DataCacheService()
count = cache.count_tasks("/path/to/index.json")
assert isinstance(count, int)
```

## Benefits

### 1. Improved Testability
- Each service can be unit tested in isolation
- Mock dependencies easily
- Test specific functionality without full TUI setup

### 2. Better Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Smaller, focused files
- Easier to understand and modify

### 3. Enhanced Extensibility
- Add new services without modifying existing ones
- Swap implementations easily
- Better dependency injection

### 4. Reduced Complexity
- Controller reduced from 1580 to ~400 lines
- Each service is under 200 lines
- Single responsibility per service

## Example: Adding a New Feature

### Before (Monolithic)
Would require:
1. Adding methods to the huge controller
2. Mixing concerns with existing code
3. Difficult to test in isolation

### After (Service-Oriented)
1. Create a new service if needed
2. Add minimal coordination logic to controller
3. Test the service independently

```python
# New feature: Task statistics service
class TaskStatisticsService:
    def __init__(self, data_cache):
        self.data_cache = data_cache

    def get_completion_rate(self, index_path):
        # Implementation
        pass

    def get_task_age_distribution(self, index_path):
        # Implementation
        pass

# In controller
self.stats_service = TaskStatisticsService(self.data_cache)
```

## Backward Compatibility

The refactored controller maintains full backward compatibility:
- Same initialization signature
- Same public methods
- Same return types
- Same behavior

## Testing the Refactored Code

Run existing tests to ensure compatibility:

```bash
# Test the refactored controller
python -m pytest tests/test_tui_controller.py -v

# Test individual services
python -m pytest tests/test_config_service.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_environment_validator.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_data_cache_service.py -v
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Dependency Injection**: Use a DI container for service creation
2. **Event Bus**: Implement event-driven communication between services
3. **Async Operations**: Make services async-aware for better concurrency
4. **Service Interfaces**: Define interfaces/protocols for services
5. **Configuration Management**: Use a more sophisticated config system

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, reverting is simple:
1. Change import back to `tui.controller`
2. Remove new service files
3. No data migration needed

The refactoring is designed to be a drop-in replacement with zero breaking changes.
